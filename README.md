## Project Overview
-----------
Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

Main goals of this task are :

- Examine transaction data - check for missing data, anomalies, outliers and clean them
- Examine customer data - similar to above transaction data
- Data analysis and customer segments - create charts and graphs, note trends and insights
- Deep dive into customer segments - determine which segments should be targetted

### Insights

1. Sales have mainly been due to Budget - older families, Mainstream - young singles/couples, and Mainstream - retirees shoppers.
2. The high spend on chips for mainstream young singles/couples and retirees is due to more of them than other buyers.
3. Mainstream, mid-age, and young singles and couples are also more likely to pay more per packet of chips. This is indicative of impulse buying behavior.
4. Mainstream young singles and couples are 23% more likely to purchase Tyrrells chips compared to the rest of the population.

Thus, the Category Manager may want to increase the categoryâ€™s performance by off-locating some Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in discretionary space near segments where young singles and couples frequent more often to increase visibility and impulse behavior.

## Task 2
Create a measure to compare different control stores to each of the trial stores to do this, write a function to reduce having to re-do the analysis for each trial store.
