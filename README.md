## Project Overview

Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. As an analyst within the Quantium analytics team I was responsible for delivering highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions.

Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customer’s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities.
The Quantium analytics team were engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful.

## Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

Conduct analysis on yotheur client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

Main goals of this task were :

- Examine transaction data - check for missing data, anomalies, outliers and clean the data
- Examine customer data - similar to above transaction data
- Data analysis and customer segments - create charts and graphs, note trends and insights
- Deep dive into customer segments - determine which segments should be targetted

### Insights

1. Sales have mainly been due to Budget - older families, Mainstream - young singles/couples, and Mainstream - retirees shoppers.
2. The high spend on chips for mainstream young singles/couples and retirees is due to more of them than other buyers.
3. Mainstream, mid-age, and young singles and couples are also more likely to pay more per packet of chips. This is indicative of impulse buying behavior.
4. Mainstream young singles and couples are 23% more likely to purchase Tyrrells chips compared to the rest of the population.

Thus, the Category Manager may want to increase the category’s performance by off-locating some Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in discretionary space near segments where young singles and couples frequent more often to increase visibility and impulse behavior.

## Task 2. Experimentation and uplift testing

Create a measure to compare different control stores to each of the trial stores to do this, write a function to reduce having to re-do the analysis for each trial store.

Main goals of this task were :

- Select control stores – explored the data and define metrics for the control stores.
- Assessment of the trial – overall performance of each trial store individually in comparison with the control store.
- Collate findings – summarised  findings for each store and provided a recommendation outlining the impact on sales during the trial period.

### Insights

- Found control stores 233, 155, 237 for trial stores 77, 86, and 88 respectively.

- The results for trial stores 77 and 88 during the trial period show a significant difference in at least two of the three trial months, but this is not the case for trial store 86.
We can check with the client if the implementation of the trial was different in trial store 86, but overall, the trial showed a significant increase in sales.
